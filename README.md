# JavaScript SDK to interact with Streamflow protocol.

Check `packages/` folder for specific exports that you can use in your apps.

We currently only have `packages/stream` which enables you to:

1. `create`, `withdraw`, `cancel`, `topup` and `transfer` a stream,

2. `getOne` stream and `get` multiple streams.
